# Front End Capstone: Datr
This is my front-end capstone for Nashville Software school. Datr is a CRUD Web Application designed to allow Users to view, save, and upload potential Dating locations in the city of Nashville.

Each Date also has an average rating which is provided by User scores. The rating system was custom built for the project.
